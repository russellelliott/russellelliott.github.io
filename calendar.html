	<h1>Fixing the Calendar</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar">Gregorian calendar</a> is the <a title="Calendar" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar">calendar</a>&nbsp;used in most of the world. It is named after <a title="Pope Gregory XIII" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pope_Gregory_XIII">Pope Gregory XIII</a>, who introduced it in October 1582.</p>
<p>While the calendar is renowned for its accuracy, there are some <a href="https://www.infoplease.com/curious-history-gregorian-calendar">issues</a>&nbsp;in the organization of the calendar:</p>
<ul>
<li>It cannot be divided into equal halves or quarters</li>
<li>The number of days per month is haphazard.</li>
<li>Months and years may begin on any day of the week, making the preceding calendar useless.</li>
<li>Holidays pegged to specific dates may also fall on any day of the week.</li>
</ul>

<a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirty_Days_Hath_September">Thirty Days Hath September</a>
<blockquote>Thirty days hath September,<br>
April, June, and November,<br>
All the rest have thirty-one,<br>
But February's twenty-eight,<br>
The LEAP YEAR, which comes once in four,<br>
Gives February one day more.</blockquote>

<h1>Calendar Converters</h1>
<p>There are several proposed calendar reforms. I have programmed six calendar converters, which can be found by clicking on their respective hyperlinks below.</p>
<h2>Development Key</h2>
<span style = "background-color:orange">Developed in CodeHS Javascript</span>
<br>
<span style = "background-color:yellow">Modified/Developed in HTML/Javascript</span>
<br>
<span style = "background-color:yellowgreen">Integrated division operator to enable calendar to work with all dates</span>
<br>
<span style = "background-color:powderblue">User Interface Simplified</span>

<h2>Development Info</h2>
<p>These calendar programs are programmed in Javascript and organized in an interactive HTML page. They are all spawned from the International Fixed Calendar (IFC) program. Initially developed in CodeHS on a CodeHS canvas, the IFC program was modified to operate on an HTML webpage for easier use and programability. The other calendars are spawned from this code, with modifications to the year start, and/or month length and number of months.</p>
<h3>May 28, 2020</h3>
<p>Completed the IFC converter on CodeHS and embedded that canvas onto the website. However, the converter didn't work on mobile devices, which motivated me to alter the code to work on HTMl pages on both desktop and mobile as well as creating more calendar converters.</p>
<h3>September 8 - October 7, 2020</h3>
<p>Completed the calendar converters for the six calendar converters.</p>
<h3>October 23, 2020</h3>
<p>An issue previously present in these programs was the conversion system, stemmed from dividing the number of days from the year start. On desktop, the user's date was limited to between January 1 and December 1 of a common year. However, a person on a mobile device can circumvent this limit, rendering undersirable output, as at the time, there was no failsafe to this issue. On October 23, 2020, all calendar programs recieved a modification which enabled the calendar program to operate properly for all dates and years.</p>
<p>diffDays -= Math.floor(365.2425*(Math.floor(Days/365.2425)))</p>
<p>If the day goes over the number of days in that year, the exceeding number of days are removed. 365.2425 is the number of days in the Gregorian calendar, the calendar currently in use (as of October 23, 2020), which is used to calculate the dates to and from the respective calendar reforms.</p>
<h3>October 31, 2020</h3>
<p>Completed the Kalentris Calendar converter using similar code to the other converters at the time. However, I neglected to include it on the website because I planned on releasing it along with the Kalentris Time Converter.</p>
<h3>Janaury 10, 2021</h3>
<p>The calendar programs have been redone so the user doesn't have to enter the year number. User interface has been cleaned up and simplified for a better experience for the user. Also, the IFC and Reddit Calendar converters have been combined into one program because they start on the same day.</p>
<h3>January 11, 2021</h3>
<p>Completed Kalentris Time Converter</p>

            <h1>13 Month calendar</h1>
            <p><a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calendar_reform">Calendar Reform</a></p>
            <p>There have been several proposals for a 13-month calendar. Each month has 28 days, with one day left over in a common year (Year Day) and another day left over in a Leap Year (Leap Day). The left subcolumn of each column lists the month names, while the right subcolumn lists the Gregorian dates the months encompass.</p>
